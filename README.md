## 📁 Project Structure

### Core Files

#### `todo.dart`

This file defines the `Todo` data model which is the foundation of the application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
class Todo {
  final String id;
  final String title;
  final String? description;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime? dueDate;
  final bool isCompleted;
  final String category;

  Todo({
    required this.id,
    required this.title,
    this.description,
    required this.createdAt,
    this.dueDate,
    this.isCompleted = false,
    this.category = 'General',
  });

  Todo copyWith({
    String? id,
    String? title,
    String? description,
    DateTime? createdAt,
    DateTime? dueDate,
    bool? isCompleted,
    String? category,
  }) {
    return Todo(
      id: id ?? this.id,
      title: title ?? this.title,
      description: description ?? this.description,
      createdAt: createdAt ?? this.createdAt,
      dueDate: dueDate ?? this.dueDate,
      isCompleted: isCompleted ?? this.isCompleted,
      category: category ?? this.category,
    );
  }
}
```

Key aspects:
- 🔒 Uses immutable design pattern with final fields
- 🔄 Implements `copyWith()` method for creating modified copies without changing the original
- 🔘 Supports optional fields like description and dueDate
- 🏷️ Includes category classification for better organization

#### `login_screen.dart`

The login screen serves as the entry point to the application:

```dart
class LoginScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // Login screen implementation
}
```

Key features:
- 🌈 Gradient background with modern UI design
- ✅ Form validation for email and password fields
- 🚀 Navigation to the home screen upon successful login
- 🔑 "Forgot Password" functionality placeholder

Implementation details:
- 📝 Uses `TextFormField` with validation for form inputs
- 📋 Implements a `Form` widget with `GlobalKey<FormState>` for validation control
- 🎨 Custom styling with rounded corners and appropriate icons

#### `home_screen.dart`

The main dashboard where users manage their todos:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'todo.dart';
import 'todo_provider.dart';
import 'todo_details_screen.dart';

class HomeScreen extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  final String userName;
  const HomeScreen({super.key, required this.userName});

  @override
  _HomeScreenState createState() => _HomeScreenState();
}
```

Key features:
- 🔍 Task filtering by category and search text
- 📋 Task list with completion status indicators
- ➕ Add new tasks through a modal bottom sheet
- 🗑️ Delete tasks with long press
- 📱 Navigate to task details screen

Implementation details:
- 🔄 Uses Riverpod for state management with `ConsumerStatefulWidget`
- 🔍 Implements search functionality with real-time filtering
- 🏷️ Category dropdown for filtering tasks
- 📝 Task entry form with date picker for due dates
- 🚦 Visual indicators for task status (completed, pending, overdue)

Key features:
- 🔄 Uses `ConsumerWidget` from Riverpod to access the state
- 🔎 Displays detailed information about a specific todo
- ✏️ Enables editing of todo title, description, and due date
- 💾 Provides a save button to update the todo through the provider
- 📆 Shows creation date for reference
- 📅 Implements a date picker for modifying due dates

### 🧠 State Management

#### `todo_provider.dart`

The app uses `flutter_riverpod` for state management, with a dedicated provider for todos:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'todo.dart';

class TodoNotifier extends StateNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  TodoNotifier() : super([]);  // Initialize with empty todo list

  void addTodo(Todo todo) {
    state = [...state, todo];  // Create new list with added todo
  }

  void toggleComplete(String id) {
    state = state.map((todo) {
      if (todo.id == id) {
        return todo.copyWith(isCompleted: !todo.isCompleted);  // Toggle completion status
      }
      return todo;
    }).toList();
  }

  void deleteTodo(String id) {
    state = state.where((todo) => todo.id != id).toList();  // Filter out deleted todo
  }

  void updateTodo(Todo updatedTodo) {
    state = state.map((todo) {
      if (todo.id == updatedTodo.id) {
        return updatedTodo;  // Replace with updated version
      }
      return todo;
    }).toList();
  }
}

final todoProvider = StateNotifierProvider<TodoNotifier, List<Todo>>((ref) {
  return TodoNotifier();
});
```

Key aspects:
- 🧠 Uses `StateNotifier` from Riverpod for immutable state management
- 🔄 Implements pure functions that return new state objects rather than modifying existing ones
- 🛠️ Provides CRUD operations for todos:
  - ➕ `addTodo`: Adds a new todo to the list
  - ✅ `toggleComplete`: Toggles the completion status of a todo
  - 🗑️ `deleteTodo`: Removes a todo from the list
  - 🔄 `updateTodo`: Updates an existing todo with new values
- 🌐 The `todoProvider` is exposed as a global access point that components can use to read or modify the todo list

## 📥 App Architecture and Workflow

The CheckMe Todo app follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **📊 Data Layer**: Represented by the `Todo` model class which defines the structure of the data.

2. **🧠 State Management Layer**: Handled by `TodoNotifier` and Riverpod providers, which manage the state of the application and provide methods to modify it.

3. **🎨 UI Layer**: Consists of screens and widgets that display the data and interact with the user.

### 👤 User Flow

1. User logs in through the `LoginScreen`
2. Upon successful login, they are directed to the `HomeScreen` where they can:
   - 👀 View their list of todos
   - 🔍 Filter todos by category or search text
   - ➕ Add new todos via the floating action button
   - ✅ Mark todos as complete/incomplete
